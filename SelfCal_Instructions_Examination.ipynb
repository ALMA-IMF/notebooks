Create a mask based on that dirty image, using either the [region-based threshold approach](https://github.com/ALMA-IMF/reduction/blob/master/reduction/make_custom_mask.py) (see below) or CRTF region files (i.e., regions drawn onto the image as you normally do in an interactive clean session).\n",

    "1. Perform a phase-only self-calibration\n",
    "1. Reject any _fields_ in the self-calibration with inadequate signal-to-noise using [heuristics](https://github.com/ALMA-IMF/reduction/blob/master/reduction/selfcal_heuristics.py).  This stage is essential for our mosaiced fields, in which some pointings will have no signal at all.\n",
